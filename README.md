# TutorQuest

## Description

TutorQuest is an application designed to connect students with tutors for personalized 1 on 1 learning experiences. It aims to simplify finding tutors and booking tutoring sessions, making education more accessible and efficient for everyone. No matter where you are, you can book a session since online options are available as well.

## Usage

To get started with TutorQuest, visit the website and sign up as either a student or a tutor. Complete the registration form with your details and select your user type. Once registered, students can begin their journey by using the search feature to find tutors based on the subject they need help with and the tutor's availability. Clicking on a tutor's profile will reveal more details, including their qualifications, the subjects they teach, and their availability.

Once a suitable tutor is found, students can book a session by selecting an available time slot. A confirmation email with the Zoom link is sent upon booking. Tutors list their subjects and availability, keep their schedules up to date, and confirm booking requests. Sessions are conducted using the provided Zoom link.

Email notifications ensure both students and tutors are informed. Students receive a confirmation email with the Zoom link, and tutors get notifications of new booking requests to confirm or decline.
